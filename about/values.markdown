# Values

## Introduction

Our values are the foundation on which we build a world-class organization.

- Empathy
- Transparency
- Optimize for people
- Right over easy
- Take long-term bets and expect occasional failure

### Why have values?

> Out of timber so crooked as that from which man is made, nothing entirely straight can be built.

— Immanuel Kant

We recognize that it is more difficult to adhere to values than to simply not have them at all. We also understand that values are aspirational and, as Kant speaks to above, we are inherently flawed creatures.

We list our values because we want to publicly show what is important to those who join our cause, as customer or employee or investor. By no means are these our only values, nor are they the right values for every person or company. They are what inspire and guide our actions at Seneca, and they are right for us.

### What constitutes a value?

We believe that values with which anyone would agree, in all circumstances, are worthless. If there is not a rational other side, what you're agreeing to is likely common sense or human decency.

For example, Facebook famously championed the phrase "Move fast and break things" as a core engineering value. As a young social network, that absolutely makes sense. The consequences of throwing hacks against the wall to see what sticks are ultimately rather low.

Working with government, on the other hand, requires a much higher emphaisis on stability. Trust — that we are always available, that we never lose data — is the foundation of our business. Such a cavalier attitude towards user's trust is not what we believe in, but more importantly not what makes sense in our context.

## Empathy

> It's a matter of my choosing to do the work of somehow altering or getting free of my natural, hard-wired default setting which is to be deeply and literally self-centered and to see and interpret everything through this lens of self. People who can adjust their natural default setting this way are often described as being "well-adjusted", which I suggest to you is not an accidental term.

— David Foster Wallace, This is Water

Every employee, as a prerequisite to being hired, must have our trust and faith. Feedback should come from a place of love and respect, under the assumption that everyone has acted with the best of intentions.

While intentions are not a metric of success, we are infinitely more likely to find success, in business and in life, if we take a little extra time to consider where the other person is coming from.

## Transparency

Every decision, at every level, should be justifiable to every other employee. While we may disagree, outright secrecy or passively choosing to not share certain pieces of information should be a sign that you shouldn't have done it in the first place.

Presentation conveys as much, if not more, than the raw data. Facts should never be knowingly skewed, misrepresented, or 'massaged' to imply untruths. What others walk away believing is infinitely more important that what you literally said.

## People are all that matter

> The really important kind of freedom involves attention and awareness and discipline, and being able truly to care about other people and to sacrifice for them over and over in myriad petty, unsexy ways every day.

— David Foster Wallace, This is Water

Every action we take should be a long-term net win for human happiness.

At the end of the day, there is no abstract entity called Seneca Systems; only the sum of the brilliant, passionate, caring individuals who work there. There is no government without its constituents or civil servants.

## Choose what is right over what is easy

> New Google employees (we call ‘Nooglers’) often ask me what makes me effective at what I do. I tell them only half-jokingly that it's very simple: I do the Right Thing for Google and the world, and then I sit back and wait to get fired.

> If I don't get fired, I've done the Right Thing for everyone. If I do get fired, this is the wrong employer to work for in the first place. So, either way, I win. That is my career strategy.

— Chade-Meng Tan

> The time is always right to do what is right.

— Martin Luther King

Very rarely do people actively choose the morally wrong option. Oftentimes, doing what is right is in conflict with doing what is easy. We should be proud of every decision we make, support each other in making the tough calls, and celebrate those who do.

## Take long-term risks and expect occasional failure

> You're afraid of making mistakes. Don't be. Mistakes can be profited by. Man, when I was young I shoved my ignorance in people's faces. They beat me with sticks. By the time I was forty my blunt instrument had been honed to a fine cutting point for me.

> If you hide your ignorance, no one will hit you and you'll never learn.

— Professor Faber, Fahrenheit 451

> If you don't aim too high, then you aim too low

— J. Cole

If we hit 100% of our targets, we aren't aiming high enough. If every campaign we launch is a smashing success, we aren't taking enough risks. We will build a team that is guaranteed to produce a good business, and we'll risk it for a legendary one.

This does not excuse building a shitty experience; everything we put our name on should be of top quality. We simply recognize that “the best laid plans of mice and men often go awry”.
